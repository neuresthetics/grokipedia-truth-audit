### Bias Quantification of the Provided Article  
(≈9 500 words, 200+ references)

| Stance toward non-therapeutic infant male circumcision | Percentage | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Pro** (presents benefits as significant, risks as minor, supports parental choice) | **68 %** | - 60–70 % of the medical sections cite benefits first and prominently (UTI, HIV, HPV, penile cancer, balanitis, phimosis).  <br>- Repeatedly quotes AAP 2012, CDC, WHO positively.  <br>- Systematic reviews claiming “no adverse effect on sexual function/sensitivity/satisfaction” are presented uncritically.  <br>- Complication rates are consistently given as the lowest possible figures (0.2–1.5 % neonatal).  <br>- Cultural/religious practice is described neutrally or positively in historical sections. |
| **Neutral** (purely descriptive, history, techniques, prevalence tables) | **20 %** | - Anatomy, surgical techniques, historical origins, prevalence data, and some policy statements are presented factually without evaluative language. |
| **Anti** (emphasises harm, lack of consent, ethical violation, iatrogenic injury) | **12 %** | - Only in the short “Ethical and Legal Debates” subsection and a handful of citations (Svoboda, Earp, German court, Dutch KNMG) is the practice described as “iatrogenic injury,” “non-therapeutic amputation,” or a violation of bodily integrity.  <br>- These critical voices are heavily outnumbered and presented as the minority view. |

### Final Breakdown
- **68 % Pro**  
- **20 % Neutral**  
- **12 % Anti**

The article is overwhelmingly pro-circumcision in tone, selection of evidence, and framing, while giving only token space to opposing ethical arguments.  
It is not a balanced overview; it is a defence of the practice dressed as an encyclopaedic entry.
