# Circumcision

**Current article is heavily biased toward non-therapeutic infant male circumcision (NTIMC).**  
It presents contested prophylactic benefits as decisive while systematically downplaying or omitting the certain, irreversible loss of healthy erogenous tissue from a non-consenting minor.

## Core Problems (with exact references to existing sections)

1. **Loss of the foreskin is not a neutral or minor change**  
   The foreskin is 30–50 cm² of immunologically active, densely innervated erogenous tissue containing the majority of the penis’s fine-touch receptors (Taylor 1996, Sorrells 2007, Cold & Taylor 1999). Its permanent removal is 100 % certain and irreversible. Current article treats this as incidental.

2. **Benefits are marginal or context-specific in developed nations**  
   - Infant UTI: baseline risk ~1 %; NNT ≈ 100–111 (AAP 2012 expired policy)  
   - Penile cancer: lifetime risk <1/100 000 in developed nations (CDC 2023)  
   - HIV: 60 % relative reduction from African adult voluntary trials; not applicable to neonatal circumcision in low-prevalence heterosexual settings or MSM (Templeton 2009, Wiysonge 2011)

3. **Ethical framing is inverted**  
   Current article frames parental proxy consent as ethically valid for irreversible, non-therapeutic genital surgery. This is rejected by:  
   - German Regional Court Cologne 2012 (criminal bodily harm)  
   - Royal Dutch Medical Association 2010 (postpone until age of consent)  
   - Council of Europe Resolution 1952 (2013)  
   - Brussels Collaboration on Bodily Integrity (2019) – 40+ scholars: “medically unnecessary genital cutting on non-consenting children violates bodily integrity”

4. **Complication rates are selectively quoted**  
   Current article uses lowest possible figures (0.2–0.5 %) from US hospital data while omitting:  
   - CDC 2014: 10-fold higher risk at age 1–9, 20-fold higher at ≥10  
   - WHO 2020: traditional circumcision in Africa has up to 35 % complication rate  
   - Meatal stenosis: 5–10 % of circumcised boys (Joudi 2011)

5. **Sexual function data are misrepresented**  
   Claim of “no adverse effect” relies on Morris & Krieger 2013 (disclosed circumcision advocate) while ignoring:  
   - Bronselaer 2013 (Belgian survey, n=1 369): reduced orgasm intensity, increased difficulty  
   - Sorrells 2007: foreskin is the most sensitive part of the penis to fine touch  
   - Frisch 2011: higher rate of sexual difficulties in circumcised Danish men

## Requested Changes

1. Move “Ethical and Legal Debates” to the top of the article (current 12 % → 30 % weight)  
2. Add subsection: “The foreskin is healthy, functional, erogenous tissue” with Taylor, Sorrells, Cold & Taylor citations  
3. Replace AAP 2012 expired policy with current AAP 2022 statement (neutral) and CPS/RACP/Dutch KNMG positions  
4. Include German court ruling, Brussels Collaboration, and UN CRC Article 24(3) interpretations  
5. Present absolute risk reductions and NNT for all claimed benefits  
6. State explicitly: “Non-therapeutic infant male circumcision is irreversible genital surgery performed without personal consent”

This would bring the article closer to neutral, evidence-based reporting rather than advocacy.
