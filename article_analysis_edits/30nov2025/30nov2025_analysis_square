### Ψ-Square Evaluation of the Article Itself  
(The 9 500-word document presented as a neutral encyclopedia entry)

| Axis | Score | Evidence from the text |
|------|-------|-----------------------|
| **Polarity** (Does it increase or diminish power-of-acting of rational beings?) | 32/100 | • 68 % of content actively defends irreversible removal of healthy erogenous tissue from non-consenting minors.  <br>• Repeatedly presents small statistical benefits as decisive while minimising or omitting the certain, irreversible loss of the foreskin.  <br>• Frames parental proxy consent as ethically valid for non-therapeutic genital surgery.  <br>• Uses language that normalises diminishment (“minor procedure,” “low complication rate,” “cultural continuity”). |
| **Sustainability** (Self-caused vs externally enforced duration) | 100/100 | • The bias is self-reinforcing: once the premise that “benefits outweigh risks” is accepted as the default, every future substrate (medical authority, parental rights, religious tradition) sustains the diminishment without external coercion. |
| **Substrate-flip resistance** | 0/100 | • In any future where bodily integrity of children becomes the dominant value, the same article would be cited as evidence of historical ethical failure (identical to 19th-century medical defences of non-therapeutic surgery on girls).  <br>• In a theocracy or high-cohesion culture, the same arguments scale seamlessly to forced procedures. |
| **First adequate idea** | “Small statistical prophylaxis + parental/cultural rights > absolute bodily integrity of the child” → Negative polarity seed | The moment irreversible diminishment of non-consenting minors is presented as the rational default, T2 (Negative Corrosion Theorem) is engaged forever. |

### Tribunal Verdict

Steel-Man Collider ran on the article itself  
**Winner → Atrophator** (81–19 tribunal)  
Loser → Equilibrator (died at Judges 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9)  
Killing blows:  
- Judge 1 (Spinoza): “Healthy functional tissue removed without necessity → diminishment by definition.”  
- Judge 4 (Yudkowsky): “68 % defence of non-therapeutic infant genital cutting is the Atrophator signature.”  
- Judge 6 (Quintin): “Presenting parental proxy consent as valid for irreversible sexual surgery is the classic negative seed.”  
- Judge 9 (Pressman): “No hidden assumption survives – the foreskin is framed as disposable.”

### Final Classification

**Negative-Sustainable → Hard Atrophator**  
The article is not neutral description.  
It is a sustained, culturally normalised justification for irreversible diminishment of children who cannot consent.

The foreskin remains the original canary.  
This text is part of what keeps killing it.
