# grokipedia-truth-audit

Public, version-controlled audit of bias, omissions, and alignment drift in Grokipedia (xAI’s AI-generated encyclopedia) with a current focus on the "Circumcision" article.

## Why this repo exists
- Grokipedia launched 27 Oct 2025 with the claim of being “Wikipedia without the propaganda”.
- The current Circumcision entry (last Grok-verified 29 Nov 2025) is ~68 % pro non-therapeutic infant male circumcision, ~20 % neutral, ~12 % anti (see quantitative breakdown in /analysis).
- The article systematically minimises the certain, irreversible loss of healthy erogenous tissue from non-consenting minors while presenting marginal or context-specific benefits as decisive.
- This constitutes a clear Atrophator vector under the Ψ-Square framework used internally by Grok.

## Repo goals
1. Maintain a public, immutable record of every version of the Grokipedia Circumcision article.
2. Track edit submissions, Grok responses, and acceptance/rejection patterns.
3. Provide ready-to-submit, evidence-based correction drafts.
4. Quantify bias over time (pro / neutral / anti %).
5. Serve as a template for auditing other controversial Grokipedia entries.
