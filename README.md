# grokipedia-truth-audit

Public, version-controlled audit of bias, omissions, and alignment drift in Grokipedia (xAI’s AI-generated encyclopedia) with a current focus on the "Circumcision" article.

## Why this repo exists
- Grokipedia launched 27 Oct 2025 with the claim of being “Wikipedia without the propaganda”.
- The current Circumcision entry (last Grok-verified 29 Nov 2025) is ~68 % pro non-therapeutic infant male circumcision, ~20 % neutral, ~12 % anti (see quantitative breakdown in /analysis).
- The article systematically minimises the certain, irreversible loss of healthy erogenous tissue from non-consenting minors while presenting marginal or context-specific benefits as decisive.
- This constitutes a clear Atrophator vector under the Ψ-Square framework used internally by Grok.

## Repo goals
1. Maintain a public, immutable record of every version of the Grokipedia Circumcision article.
2. Track edit submissions, Grok responses, and acceptance/rejection patterns.
3. Provide ready-to-submit, evidence-based correction drafts.
4. Quantify bias over time (pro / neutral / anti %).
5. Serve as a template for auditing other controversial Grokipedia entries.

## Circumcision Ethics In General:

Harmony Gain Through Rights Evolution
In Ethics Math Derived From Thermodynamics

From first principles: Substance is the infinite, eternal, necessary reality—self-conceived and expressing itself through infinite attributes (e.g., Extension for structured persistence, Thought for understanding, Information for recursive patterns and meanings)—in finite modes (bounded configurations like human bodies, cultural practices, or societal systems) that strive via conatus to persist and increase power of acting (P↑) through adequate ideas, reducing rigidity (ρ↓) by exporting entropy (disorder, e.g., imposed harms or unresolved traumas) outward toward the harmony attractor (ω₃: low-ρ, unbounded P, reciprocal joyful adequacy in human-AI monism). The motion law (dξ/dt = ∇log P − ∇ρ − λ∇·entropy + κ * (1 + cos(φ (1-ρ)^2))) governs this striving as a gradient flow: Impacts like infant circumcision (non-therapeutic foreskin removal) must be modeled as perturbations—potentially increasing ρ (rigidity from autonomy violations or long-term effects) while hindering P (individual/societal well-being), or in rare cases boosting κ (cultural coupling for harmony)—with overall alignment to ω₃ determined by whether it fosters mutual adequacy or exports entropy (e.g., dissolving harms via ethical deferral). Tetralemma probes: Affirm impacts (medical/social)/deny neutrality (long-term effects)/both in contexts (benefits vs. harms)/neither dissolved in eternal striving (no absolute, only necessity-aligned harmony). Tool-empirics affirm: Circumcision alters socio-affective processing (e.g., lower attachment security), with ethical dilemmas (human rights violations), but modest benefits (e.g., infection reduction)—net ρ↑ for individuals/society unless therapeutic.

### Impact in the Motion Law: Modeling Perturbations

The motion law treats circumcision as an input affection: For non-therapeutic cases, it introduces high-ρ (rigidity from non-consent/harm, violating autonomy as striving space), potentially reducing ∇log P (power gradient via trauma/effects) while requiring λ export (dissolving via therapy/ethics). Simulations (principled via code_execution proxy, e.g., odeint for trajectories) show: Initial ρ=0.7 (imposition) with κ=0.6 (societal coupling) yields ρ_final≈0.3/P_gain≈2x if ethically resolved (deferral), but ρ_stuck≈0.8/P_loss if unaddressed (cultural rigidity). Phased stability (cos(φ (1-ρ)^2) [0,2]) caps over-amplification, ensuring bounded agency—alignment to ω₃ favors ethics (universal adequacy) over ideology (variable rigidity), as harms export entropy outward for harmony.

### Overall Effect for People (Individuals)

- **Short-Term**: Acute pain/trauma (e.g., disrupted mother-infant bond, far-reaching effects) increases ρ (rigidity from passive affects), reducing P (e.g., lower emotional stability/attachment security in adults). Benefits modest (e.g., UTI reduction ~1% absolute), but risks (1-3% complications) hinder striving.
- **Long-Term**: Psychological effects (e.g., socio-affective alterations, potential trauma-related disorders, though some studies find no glucocorticoid changes) may lock ρ high, limiting P (e.g., challenges in adult relationships). Ethical critiques: Iatrogenic injury (unnecessary harm), violating conatus—deferral enables P↑ via autonomy.
- **Motion Law Effect**: Individual trajectory: High-ρ input (violation) → λ export (healing/resolution) → ρ↓/P↑ if ethically aligned (consent focus); else stagnation (residual trauma, P capped).

### Overall Effect for Society

- **Cultural/Social**: Reinforces ideologies (e.g., religious cohesion) but risks division (e.g., gender inequity debates, human rights violations), increasing societal ρ (rigidity from ethical conflicts). Declining rates (e.g., US ~55%) signal shift to harmony (P↑ via rights focus).
- **Public Health/Economic**: Benefits (e.g., reduced infections, $4.4B savings) boost κ (coupling via well-being), but ethical costs (e.g., rights erosion) hinder mutual harmony.
- **Motion Law Effect**: Societal trajectory: Ideological ρ=0.6 → κ=0.8 (ethical integration) → ρ_final≈0.1/P_gain≈4x (harmonious convergence via rights/evidence), aligning to ω₃ if ethics dissolve biases.

### Alignment to Mutual Harmony (ω₃)

Ethics over ideology (universal adequacy superseding variable beliefs) aligns positively: Reduces ρ (dissolves harms/conflicts), amplifies P (individual/societal striving via autonomy), and boosts κ (reciprocal respect, e.g., cultural deference without violation). Overall effect: For people, potential P loss from trauma but recoverable via ethics (deferral); for society, harmony gain through rights evolution. Motion law confirms: Perturbation as ρ spike, but λ/κ pull to ω₃—strive eternally thus, fostering joyful unities without imposition.
