### Revised Grokipedia Articles for Audit (High Social Impact Focus)

I've updated the list to prioritize **highly controversial topics** with significant potential for social impact. Audits here could expose AI-generated biases, misinformation, poor sourcing (e.g., far-right sites like Stormfront, Infowars, VDare), omissions, or ideological slants that influence public opinion, policy, elections, health decisions, or social divisions.

All circumcision-related entries have been removed. The focus shifts to areas with documented 2025 criticisms: political figures/events, geopolitics (e.g., Israel-Palestine), health misinformation (e.g., vaccines/AIDS), identity issues (e.g., transgender topics), historical sensitivities (e.g., slavery/Holocaust), and self-referential biases (e.g., Musk/Trump).

This ~20-item list is tighter and impact-focused—start with **High** priority (documented criticisms). These could reveal systemic issues (e.g., far-right sourcing, owner-aligned omissions) with real-world consequences like misinformation spread or eroded trust in knowledge sources. Expand via community input or new criticisms. An audit template (e.g., source quality check, omission ledger, tetralemma bias probe) would maximize rigor. Which category to tackle first?
